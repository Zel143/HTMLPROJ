        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            INK FIST STUDIOS was founded with a simple mission: to create the most dynamic, energetic, and visually 
            striking animations in the industry. We believe that movement is at the heart of all great visual storytelling, 
            and we push the boundaries of what's possible in animation every day.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
            Founded in 2015 by a group of passionate animators who met while working on a major fighting game title, 
            INK FIST STUDIOS began as a small collective dedicated to perfecting the art of animated combat. What started 
            as a shared passion project quickly grew into a sought-after studio, known for our distinctive style and 
            technical excellence.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
            At INK FIST, we approach each project with a blend of technical precision and artistic flair. Our process begins 
            with intensive research and reference gathering, followed by meticulous planning of key frames and motion arcs. 
            We then bring our animations to life through a combination of traditional hand-drawn techniques and cutting-edge 
            digital tools, always maintaining our signature high-energy style.
        </p>
